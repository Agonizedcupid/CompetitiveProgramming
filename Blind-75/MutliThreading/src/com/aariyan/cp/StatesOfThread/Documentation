    1. New : It means a thread has just created. Code is not executed yet.
    2. Runnable: It means Code is ready to execute / Thread is ready to execute.
    3. Blocked: When a thread is temporarily inactive. It has the following states:
        a) Blocked
        b) Waiting
    4. Timed-Waiting: When a method calls a time-out parameter. it will be that state until a notification is received or
       timeout is completed. Example:
        a)Thread.sleep():
        b)Object.wait with timeout:
        c)Thread.join with timeout:
        d)LockSupport.parkNanos:
        e)LockSupport.parkUtil
    5. Terminated: it can has two phase.
        a) Normally terminated means execution is completed.
        b) Maybe happens some unusual things like the segmentation faults or unhandled exceptions.
